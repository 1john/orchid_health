                            Orchid Health was founded with the mission of solving the
                            problems and inefficencies of modern American healthcare, and
                            to make sure that no patient or community lacked access due to
                            the current system. Our founders, Orion Falvey and Oliver
                            Alexander spent years working with a number of Oregon’s top
                            healthcare policy leaders, primary care providers, and most
                            importantly the community members in order to improve the
                            health and well-being of all patients and to create a model of
                            health care based on quality, compassion, and innovation.

                             Our goal is for our patients to feel listened to, have enough 
                             time to ask necessary questions, and be able to discuss what’s
                              most important to them with their provider. In order to accomplish 
                              this we offer hour long initial visits and 30 minute follow up 
                              visits. Additionally we understand the need for accessible 
                              primary and urgent care when a health concern arises, which is 
                              why we offer same day urgent care visits and expedited new 
                              patient visits. In order to continuously improve the experience 
                              our patients receive, we constantly ask for feedback and involve 
                              patients in our decision making process.
