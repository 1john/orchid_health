                            Orchid Health was founded with the mission of solving the
                            problems and inefficencies of modern American healthcare, and
                            to make sure that no patient or community lacked access due to
                            the current system. Our founders, Orion Falvey and Oliver
                            Alexander spent years working with a number of Oregon’s top
                            healthcare policy leaders, primary care providers, and most
                            importantly the community members in order to improve the
                            health and well-being of all patients and to create a model of
                            health care based on quality, compassion, and innovation.

                        <p>
                           Our goal is for our patients to feel listened to, have enough 
                            time to ask necessary questions, and be able to discuss what’s 
                            most important to them with their provider. In order to accomplish 
                            this we offer hour long initial visits and 30 minute follow up 
                            visits. Additionally we understand the need for accessible primary 
                            and urgent care when a health concern arises, which is why we offer 
                            same day urgent care visits and expedited new patient visits. 
                            In order to continuously improve the experience our patients 
                            receive, we constantly ask for feedback and involve patients in 
                            our decision making process.

                                        Julie moved to Oregon from Salt Lake City, Utah where she worked as an assistant
                                        professor of nursing at Roseman University. She started her career in healthcare after
                                        graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Utah in May of
                                        2000. Over her career, she has served in many clinical and hospital positions including
                                        oncology, diabetes and wound care, and truly found her passion in Home Health and
                                        Hospice. It was this love of community nursing and a desire to return to a small town
                                        that led her to continue her education, graduating with a Doctorate of Nursing Practice,

                                        Having visited Oregon in the early 1990s, the state left a great impression on her, leading her 
                                        to choose to return to Oregon permanently in 2008. Previously, she worked for PeaceHealth as a 
                                        family medicine physician in Eugene and Cottage Grove until 2015 when she joined Orchid.

                                       I’m happy to see patients one year of age and older! Her personal interests include gardening,
