                        <p>Orchid Health was founded with the mission of solving the problems and inefficiencies of modern American healthcare and to make sure that no patient or community lacked access due to the current system. Our founders, Orion Falvey and Oliver Alexander spent years working with a number of Oregon’s top healthcare policy leaders, primary care providers, and most importantly community members themselves in order to improve the health and well-being of all patients and to create a model of health care based on quality, compassion, and innovation.</p>

                        <p>
                            Our goal is for our patients to feel listened to, have enough time to ask necessary questions, and be able to discuss what’s most important to them with their provider. In order to accomplish this, we offer hour-long initial visits either online or in-person and 30-minute follow-up visits. Additionally, we understand the need for accessible primary and urgent care when a health concern arises, which is why we offer same-day visits (by appointment) for children and adults, and expedited new patient visits. In order to continuously improve the experience our patients receive, we constantly ask for feedback and involve patients in our decision-making process.
                        </p>

                            Students between the ages of 12 and 19 who visit the SBHC may be asked to complete an anonymous survey after their visit. The survey asks about the student’s satisfaction and experience at the SBHC, as well as some general questions about their physical and mental health status. Students can refuse to take the survey and this will not affect their ability to get care at the SBHC. To see a copy of the survey, please go to the “SBHC Data Requirements” link from <a href="http://healthoregon.org/sbhc">http://healthoregon.org/sbhc</a>. If you have questions about the survey, please contact the SBHC State Program Office at <a href="mailto:sbhc.program@dhsoha.state.or.us">sbhc.program@dhsoha.state.or.us</a>.
