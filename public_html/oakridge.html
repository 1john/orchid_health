                        <p>Orchid Health was founded with the mission of solving the problems and inefficiencies of modern American healthcare, and to make sure that no patient or community lacked access due to the current system. Our founders, Orion Falvey and Oliver Alexander spent years working with a number of Oregon’s top healthcare policy leaders, primary care providers, and most importantly community members themselves in order to improve the health and well-being of all patients and to create a model of health care based on quality, compassion, and innovation.</p>

                           Our goal is for our patients to feel listened to, have enough 
                            time to ask necessary questions, and be able to discuss what’s 
                            most important to them with their provider. In order to accomplish 
                            this we offer hour long initial visits and 30 minute follow up 
                            visits. Additionally we understand the need for accessible primary 
                            and urgent care when a health concern arises, which is why we offer 
                            same-day visits (by appointment) and expedited new patient visits. 
                            In order to continuously improve the experience our patients 
                            receive, we constantly ask for feedback and involve patients in 
                            our decision making process.

                                        Students between the ages of 12 and 19 who visit the SBHC may be asked to complete an anonymous survey after their visit. The survey asks about the student’s satisfaction and experience at the SBHC, as well as some general questions about their physical and mental health status. Students can refuse to take the survey and this will not affect their ability to get care at the SBHC. To see a copy of the survey, please go to the “SBHC Data Requirements” link from <a href="http://healthoregon.org/sbhc">http://healthoregon.org/sbhc</a>. If you have questions about the survey, please contact the SBHC State Program Office at <a href="mailto:sbhc.program@state.or.us">sbhc.program@state.or.us</a>.
