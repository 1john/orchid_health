                        <p>Orchid Health was founded with the mission of solving the problems and inefficiencies of modern American healthcare, and to make sure that no patient or community lacked access due to the current system. Our founders, Orion Falvey and Oliver Alexander spent years working with a number of Oregon’s top healthcare policy leaders, primary care providers, and most importantly community members themselves in order to improve the health and well-being of all patients and to create a model of health care based on quality, compassion, and innovation.</p>

                           Our goal is for our patients to feel listened to, have enough 
                            time to ask necessary questions, and be able to discuss what’s 
                            most important to them with their provider. In order to accomplish 
                            this we offer hour long initial visits and 30 minute follow up 
                            visits. Additionally we understand the need for accessible primary 
                            and urgent care when a health concern arises, which is why we offer 
                            same-day visits (by appointment) and expedited new patient visits. 
                            In order to continuously improve the experience our patients 
                            receive, we constantly ask for feedback and involve patients in 
                            our decision making process.

                                        Students between the ages of 12 and 19 who visit the SBHC may be asked to complete an anonymous survey after their visit. The survey asks about the student’s satisfaction and experience at the SBHC, as well as some general questions about their physical and mental health status. Students can refuse to take the survey and this will not affect their ability to get care at the SBHC. To see a copy of the survey, please go to the “SBHC Data Requirements” link from <a href="http://healthoregon.org/sbhc">http://healthoregon.org/sbhc</a>.

                                    <p>Shelby grew up in Connecticut and moved to Boston, Massachusetts where she lived for 10 years prior to following her husband and love of the outdoors to Oregon.  </p>
                                    
                                    <p>While in Boston, Shelby pursued a career in nursing. During nursing school she spent 3 months in Teton Valley, Idaho serving a rural mountain farming community, where her family lives today. After completing her nursing program, she was accepted into the country’s second Nurse Practitioner residency program at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Worcester, Mass. Upon completion of this residency program, she assumed a variety of leadership roles including Director of the Nurse Practitioner residency program and Director of Advanced Practice Clinicians (Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants).</p>

                                    <p>In Oregon, Shelby worked for the East County Clinic in Gresham and then OHSU’s only FQHC, the Richmond Clinic, located in SE Portland. Prior to COVID-19, Shelby started OHSU’s Doctor of Nursing Practice Program. Her clinical work and DNP project focused on the development of an outdoor and indoor respiratory clinic to support the ongoing care, testing, and treatment of high-complexity, high-risk patients throughout the pandemic. She won several awards and was featured on Oregon Public Broadcasting for her work. She is excited to transition from FQHCs to serving more rural communities.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to her clinical role, Shelby also teaches at the OHSU School of Nursing and is an active member of the Oregon Nurses Association, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, and is the Chair of the Health Policy Committee for Nurse Practitioners of Oregon.</p>

                                    <p>When not at work, Shelby enjoys running, hiking, backpacking, gardening, cooking, and reading. She also loves spending time with her family and road tripping the great states of Oregon, Washington & Idaho.</p>
