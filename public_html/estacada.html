                        <p>Orchid Health was founded with the mission of solving the problems and inefficiencies of modern American healthcare, and to make sure that no patient or community lacked access due to the current system. Our founders, Orion Falvey and Oliver Alexander spent years working with a number of Oregon’s top healthcare policy leaders, primary care providers, and most importantly community members themselves in order to improve the health and well-being of all patients and to create a model of health care based on quality, compassion, and innovation.</p>

                        <p>
                            Our goal is for our patients to feel listened to, have enough time to ask necessary questions, and be able to discuss what’s most important to them with their provider. In order to accomplish this we offer hour long initial visits and 30 minute follow up visits. Additionally we understand the need for accessible primary and urgent care when a health concern arises, which is why we offer same-day visits (by appointment) and expedited new patient visits. In order to continuously improve the experience our patients receive, we constantly ask for feedback and involve patients in our decision making process.
                        </p>

                            Students between the ages of 12 and 19 who visit the SBHC may be asked to complete an anonymous survey after their visit. The survey asks about the student’s satisfaction and experience at the SBHC, as well as some general questions about their physical and mental health status. Students can refuse to take the survey and this will not affect their ability to get care at the SBHC. To see a copy of the survey, please go to the “SBHC Data Requirements” link from <a href="http://healthoregon.org/sbhc">http://healthoregon.org/sbhc</a>.

                                    <p>Dr. Marty Grasmeder grew up in Philadelphia and moved out to the west coast with his family while entering college. Upon his move, he was accepted into Stanford University where he got his degree in Biology, followed by earning his MD from Penn State University.</p>
                                    <p>After his university, Dr. Grasmeder held a residency in pediatrics at OHSU. Dr. Grasmeder did his fellowship in children's kidneys at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>
                                    <p>Later in his career, Dr. Grasmeder decided to expand his calling and took a role as a Pediatrician in Sika, Alaska. His service extended to local indigenous tribes and he was the only pediatrician on an island town of 8,500. His career grew and flourished while in Alaska, however, his heart was in the Northwest.</p>
                                    <p>After nearly 20 years serving rural populations in Alaska, Dr. Grasmeder returned to the west coast as Multnomah County’s Medical Director. His impact at the county lasted for nearly 7 years until he semi-retired.</p>
                                    <p>Now he is returning to his roots in rural healthcare to help expand care for everyone and to improve the social fabric and network to help people thrive in their communities while creating healthy communities.</p>
                                    <p>When Dr. Grasmeder is not working; he enjoys spending his time fishing, learning about European history, spending time with his family and children, riding bikes, and woodworking.</p>

We came to your office because my wife suffered a cut from broken glass. While I'm deeply sorry about that, of course, how wonderful we made this connection, and your care was so obvious even in this sort of indirect encounter.

                                            address your problems and are very patient.
